# POSTGRES-BACK-END-CKO-PROJECT

This is a project developed by me using the most recent technologies.
The main libraries used:

<ul>
  <li>EXPRESS</li>
  <li>SEQUELIZE</li>
  <li>REDIS</li>
  <li>BCRYTJS</li>
  <li>JSONWEBTOKEN</li>
  <li>NODEMAILER</li>
  <li>DOTENV</li>
  <li>DATE-FNS</li>
  <li>MULTER</li>
  <li>CORS</li>
  <li>YUP</li>
</ul>

As the database used was "POSTGRES-SQL" using the sequelize to migrate the tables.
The database was hosted on DOCKER.

You can take a look on the back-end project opened on POSTBIRD below:
